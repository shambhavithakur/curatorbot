1. Download JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data about photos.
2. Extract download links for each photo from the JSON data.
3. Using the links, download the photos to a folder.
4. Resize and optimize the photos.
5. Save the edited photos in a separate folder.
6. Connect to Twitter via Tweepy.
7. Select an edited photo.
8. Upload it to Twitter.
